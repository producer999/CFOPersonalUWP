Features To Add:

****CamScanner API for scanning recipts (Android/iOS only)
****get rid of all enums alltogether and populate each type from a textfile with the initial list of values
****add setting to change background, header text color, recipt section color (bind the static resource colors to viewmodel)
****next to month total remaining have a "save this amount?" button to fill a "savings" account?
****add expense due warnings on summary page a few days before, adjustable via a setting
****add expense overdue warnings until expense is marked as paid
****hitting enter in textbox in list item saves the list item and makes it uneditable again - is it possible? Use plin binding?
****find a way to move popup around using manipulation delta or subclassing Popup
****use visual state to control width of the receipts box to show correctly on different resolutions
****eventually make different layouts based on size
****make it so you can use calculator in the receipt editor too
****move collection of "new" colors for types to a text file that is imported into a database table on initialization
****drag and drop image file onto the receipts list area when budget selected to add receipt
****payee editor section where you can add the address and loaction of the payees
****drag a receipt from one budget to another on the same page and it moves the receipt there (or copies, gives you a choice)

****ability to print a receipt image from receipt editor and receipt archive
****backup/import datebase button in settings
****sort in both directions on listviews and receipt lists
****different currencies (india, pakistan, europe)


Bugs:

****after changing the amount of a budget in list, when you change label it doesnt update label in chart anymore
****import a database into installation of app that already has ListOrders settings throws exception, clear settings first on import
****expense due date calendar pickers not opening to the currentexpense.Date even though the value is correct
	-if you browse to a month in the future that has an expense, then go back to the first month, the first month calendar
	 pops up as the farther in the future month that had an expense
****taking photos with the camera API, or something else to do with images is buggy
	-sometimes pictures need to be taken more than once to show the correct picture
	-occasionally even if you change the picture more than once it still doesnt update, but when you restart the app,
	 it doesn show the last image that you picked (as if it had been updating all along)
****more optimization and testing


Visual Bugs (future):

****FIX when go to another month with a collapsed list, when go back and open it it turns gray first then shows
****FIX when coming back from sleep the receipt images show all black
****FIX: you can see the previous image in the Content dialog fora split second when going to new receipt
	-when hit OK on dialog, clear the image source? and also in large popup?
****put middle (data entry) section of receipt editor in vertical scrollviewer for when window is resized small


USER EXPERIENCE

****optimization
****clicking on a chart makes it big
****make it work well on windows phone
****sync settings and data between all your devices (need to make some kind of log in?)
	-instead of receipt backup folder make it data backup and sync folder, choose dropbox or G drive folder to sync

	-when opening from database, the IncomeList and IncomeTypes lists are built separately so updating one obj doesnt do other
	-need to mantually update it in UpdateItem() and UpdateReceipt() method in current month
****tool tips over the textbox entry fields saying what field its supposed to be

11/8/17
